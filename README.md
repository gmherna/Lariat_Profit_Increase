# Lariat Rental Car Profit Increase
Thinkful Capstone Exercise #1

I am working for a fictional rental car company, Lariat, assigned to analyze current data to provide insights and recommendations to increase profit through expansion and/or cost reduction.
Three courses of actions (COA) were determined to explore change on profit. Using Microsoft Excel, clean, reorganize, and create a dashboard for each COA.

COA 1: Change the fleet to capitalize on profitable vehicles. Dashboard linked to a bar chart showing top and bottom 5 profit producing vehicles. Allow user to change fleet count to see difference in profits.

COA 2: Maximize profit based on season. Dashboard linked with a pie chart showing total revenue for fall, spring, summer, and winter. Allow user to add a percent increase or decrease to see how revenue increases based on season.

COA 3: Compare revenue by state. Dashboard linked to a bar graph showing top 5 revenue producing states. Allow user to change number of branches to see effect on revenue compared to other states.

Create a PowerPoint presentations with dashboard visualizations and present to Lariat marketing leadership all three COAs with recommendations. Each COA is independent and requires specific timeline, coordination, and investment to achieve each change.
